    <h3>Satisfied with the faculty and surroundings.</h3>
    <h4>Placements:</h4>
    <p>There are no placements at all in our college. This is the college for those who are already working in
        organisations and want to complete post-graduation. As there is no mandatory attendance, students can come and
        write only exams and lab exams.</p>
    <h4>Infrastructure:</h4>
    <p>The facilities and infrastructure available for our course are average. There is no proper maintenance in labs.
        Library and classrooms are also just fine. There is no Wi-Fi at all. There is no hostel provided, and no sports
        and games are provided.</p>
    <h4>Faculty:</h4>
    <p>The teachers are helpful, qualified and knowledgeable. The teaching quality is good. The course is curriculum
        relevant. I don't think it makes the students industry-ready. Semester exams in this college are not that
        difficult as they provide important topics before exams.</p>
    <h4>Other:</h4>
    <p>Campus surroundings are awesome. The campus has greenery around and lake view.</p>
